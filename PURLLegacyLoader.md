# PURL Legacy Loader instructions #

A legacy loader is available to take old OCLC version 1 PURL database dumps and upload PURLs into this projectâ€™s RESTful API. This is not production code, but is provided in the hope that it may be useful to operators of old PURL servers wishing to migrate to a more modern PURL server.  At least three PURL server installations have used this code to date.
